Custom keyboard for decimal and hexadecimal entry fields

This app is an example and experimental.
It is a custom keyboard that uses a ContentView as overlay page.

Note for iOS:

The 'await scrollView.ScrollToAsync(label, ScrollToPosition.Center, true)' does not work like in Android.
It centers horizontally and vertically for all the Entry controls in iOS even though the Orientation is only set to Vertical.
