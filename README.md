Custom keyboard for decimal and hexadecimal entry fields

This app is an example and experimental.
It is a custom keyboard that uses a bottomsheet.
This works reasonably well in Android but less so in iOS.
The bottomsheet is apparently always modal in iOS and does not always open when switching from
portrait to landscape (and vice versa) if a different keyboard layout is used for portrait and landscape.
